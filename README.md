# Colorful Conway's Game of Life

A Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using **Python** and **Pygame**. This project adds colors to each living cell and allows you to draw on the grid when the game is paused.

## Overview
This project was made to push my understanding of programming fundamentals and the use of a graphics library like **Pygame**. I used **Python** for all the logic—managing a grid to track cell placement and **Pygame** for rendering.
<br />
<br />
The rules of Conway's Game of Life are :
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Gameplay Controls
- Left mouse : Draw on the grid by adding or remove a cell.
- Space key : Start or pause the game.
